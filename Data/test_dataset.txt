I1.1	To make the pie crust, mix together flour, some of the sugar, and some of the salt. Add butter and use your fingers or a food processor to combine, just until large clumps form. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the water a little at a time, using your fingers to lightly mix. Continue until all the water has absorbed and a crumbly dough has formed. If dough seems dry, add more water, a tablespoon at a time.
I1.2	Scrape dough onto a lightly floured work surface and press the dough into a compact disc, then halve and form each half into a disc. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour.
I1.3	For the filling, combine remaining sugar with lemon zest in a large bowl. Add cornstarch and salt and whisk until combined, then add cherries and toss to coat. If using frozen cherries, be sure to drain off any excess juice after thawing and before combining with other ingredients for filling.
I1.4	Preheat oven to 190°C/375°F and grease a pie dish (9-inch/23-cm.) Take dough out of refrigerator and let warm up for a few minutes. On a lightly floured work surface, roll one disc into a 0.25-in./0.5-cm thick round. Transfer the round to the pie dish, letting the excess hang over the edge, and distribute cherry filling evenly on top.
I1.5	Roll second dough disk into a round of same thickness and cut into 1-in./2.5-cm wide strips. Use the strips to form a lattice pattern over the cherry filling.
I1.6	Trim the bottom and top dough, leaving 0.5-in./1.33-cm of dough hanging over the sides. Lift the sides up and fold them under the dough edge to form a thick crust, then crimp the sides or simply press to seal the dough together. Beat the egg and brush it on top of the lattice dough. Sprinkle generously with demerara sugar. Bake pie at 190°C/375°F for approx. 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling. Let cool completely before serving. Enjoy!
