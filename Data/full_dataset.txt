R211	wedding-cake	9
I211.1	Preheat the oven to 175°C/350°F. Butter cake pans, line bottoms with parchment, and dust with flour, dusting off any excess. Combine milk, some of the egg whites, and some of the vanilla bean seeds; whisk until blended.
I211.2	Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. On low speed, gradually add some of the butter and mix until it resembles moist crumbs. Add half of the milk mixture and beat on medium speed for approx. 2 minutes. Add second half and beat for approx. 1 minute longer. Scrape down sides of bowl, then beat mixture for approx. 30 more seconds.
I211.3	Divide batter evenly between the 8-inch/20-cm pans. Bake for approx. 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Let cool for approx. 10 minutes before turning out onto cooling rack. Allow to cool completely before removing parchment paper from the bottom of cakes and wrapping tightly in plastic wrap. Chill in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to 5 days; or store in freezer for up to 2 weeks. Make batter two more times, each time baking one 6-inch/15-cm and one 10-inch/25-cm cake together. The 6-inch/15-cm cakes will bake for approx. 20 minutes, and the 10-inch/25-cm cakes will bake for approx. 40 minutes.
I211.4	To make buttercream, fill pot with a few inches of water and bring to a slow simmer. In heat proof bowl or bowl of stand mixer, combine egg whites and sugar. Place bowl over pot of simmering water. Heat mixture, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 70°C/160°F or the sugar is completely dissolved. Transfer bowl to stand mixer or use hand mixer to beat egg whites, gradually increasing speed, until they form stiff peaks and bowl and meringue have cooled to the touch. With mixer running, add vanilla, then add butter gradually, until all is incorporated and buttercream is light and smooth. This can take time; continue to beat until it comes together. Make the buttercream recipe one more time. Store in airtight container if not using immediately, though fresh buttercream is best for decorating.
I211.5	Assemble each tier: level each cake by slicing off a thin, even layer off top to create a level surface. Cut each cake in half so each tier has four layers. For each tier, smear a dab of buttercream onto corresponding cake board. Place first layer of cake down on top of cake board, then spread thin layer of jam onto it. Place next layer of cake on top and spread a layer of buttercream on top. Continue until tier is complete and place in refrigerator to chill. Repeat with each tier.
I211.6	Apply a crumb coat to each tier by spreading a thin layer of buttercream over the tops and sides. Scrape and clean spatula as you go to prevent spreading more crumbs into buttercream. Place tiers in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to firm up before proceeding.
I211.7	When tiers are firm, frost each with final layer of buttercream in the style you prefer. Return tiers to refrigerator to firm up for at least an hour or up to 24 hours. When tiers are firm, prepare to insert straw dowels: Measure and mark the 10-inch/25-cm tier by centering an empty 8-inch/20-cm cake pan over it and pressing down gently to mark where that tier will go. Do the same with an empty 6-inch/15-cm pan over the 8-inch/20-cm tier.
I211.8	Just inside the marks on the 10-inch/25-cm tier, insert straws (or wooden dowels) at 12-, 3-, 6-, and 9-o’clock positions. Mark where cake meets straw, then remove it and trim just below the mark so that it disappears when reinserted in cake. Push straws back into cake. Repeat process with 8-inch/20-cm tier, using 3 straws at 12-, 4-, and 8-o’clock positions. Use buttercream to smooth over holes.
I211.9	To finish cake, place cake board onto cake turntable. Dollop a tablespoon of buttercream onto board and center 10-inch/25-cm tier on top. Dollop another tablespoon of buttercream on top of that tier, and use your hand and an offset spatula to gently lower the 8-inch/20-cm tier on top, making sure that it’s centered. Repeat with 6-inch/15-cm tier. Use piping bag to fill seams between tiers either with tiny dots to resemble pearls or a star tip to create a ribbon around cake. Decorate with fresh flowers or as you prefer, transfer to serving plate, and enjoy!
R212	fennel-arugula-and-apple-salad	4

R213	cheese-and-spinach-triangles	1
I213.1	Among the most reviled foods, spinach ranks somewhere in the top tier—for younger people, at least. Query a bunch of random teenagers on the street and most of them will probably name this leafy green vegetable as their least favorite – hot on the heels of Brussels sprouts, of course, which is by far the worst offender, according to popular opinion.   As an avid hobby cook, much like me, you may have already realized that the way food tastes is largely influenced by its method of preparation. How to solve the spinach quandary then? Just throw in some cheese and hide it all under a blanket of fluffy dough. Your kids will love our cheese and spinach triangles and might even ask to take them to school the next day. No kids at home? They’re fantastic for lunch or as a quick and easy dinner.

I216.1	Birds are singing in the trees, the first rays of sun are tickling my face and temperatures have finally risen to double digits: Time to fire up that grill. A bit premature you say? Could it be that a sudden burst of Vitamin D induced euphoria made me overreact?

Or could it be that I’m just experiencing a massive craving for grilled pineapples with a generous helping of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce? Yup, I guess that’s it.

R227	scrambled-eggs-in-a-mug	1
I227.1	Late risers can probably relate to the following scenario: after hitting the snooze button at least three times before finally wrestling your half-asleep body out of bed, you end up squeezing your morning routine into a very narrow window of time.   As a courtesy to others—particularly those who might have to smell your B.O. in a jam-packed commuter train—you ditch a proper, healthy breakfast in favor of a refreshing morning shower. This wakes you up, of course. But it doesn’t do much for your hunger. How to solve this quandary? You have two options: grab an overpriced, on-the-go sandwich or chef up a quick, delightfully delish breakfast treat in the form of scrambled eggs in a cup with shallots, bacon, and fresh basil.  Check out the full recipe in the video.

So invite them over and treat them to a giant cookie feast. And don’t forget to top it off with a scoop of ice cream.

R352	mini-deep-dish-pizzas	1
I352.1	When thinking of pizza, America might not be the first thing that comes to mind. Yet, it is by far the number one place for every aficionado to pig out on a wide variety of different kinds of za. Since its introduction to the US by Italian immigrants in the late 19th century, pizza has steadily grown in popularity, and is by now considered a staple of American cuisine. The original Neapolitan pizza remains a universally loved and cherished dish; however, every region boasts its own unique recipe, which sometimes strays from what is considered to be the real deal. While New York-style pizza, with its thin, flexible crust and southern Italian-style marinara sauce, comes closest to the original, Chicago-style pizza stands in a category of its own. Also known as Chicago deep dish pizza, it doubles down on everything: a thick pie-like crust serves as a foundation for copious amounts of chunky tomato sauce, cheese and other toppings such as onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Sound like something you might enjoy? Then check out our recipe for mini deep dish pizzas that you can find in this video!

I368.3	Then add some of the sesame oil, fish sauce, sake, soy sauce, some of the pear juice, sugar, salt, and pepper to the paste and mix again using the food processor.
I368.4	Cut beef into slices approx. 0.5 cm thin.
I368.5	Add beef slices to the marinade and leave covered in a cold place for approx. 1 - 2 hours. Resealable freezer bags are particularly effective for this, as they save storage space.

Now, heat up vegetable oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Pour hot oil over fish and sprinkle soy sauce on top. Enjoy!
R371	lemon-cake	4
I371.1	Beat soft butter, sugar, and vanilla sugar until creamy. This step is important and shouldn’t be skipped. Add lemon zest and part of the lemon juice, and mix. Add eggs individually and mix well after each egg. The batter should now be creamy and beige or light yellow. It’s best to use free-range eggs, as they are better for the hens and give a nicer color to the cake.
I371.2	Mix cornstarch, flour, and baking powder in a second bowl. Sift flour and baking powder first. Instead of flour, you can use ground almonds or hazelnuts (the gluten-free alternative). Add dry ingredients to butter mixture and mix well. Add yogurt with a cooking spoon. The batter should be light and fluffy, but not runny, similar to the consistency of Nutella.
I371.3	Grease cake pan (I used a small 18-cm round one) and pour batter into pan. Bake approx. 50 min. at 170°C/350°F. As temperatures can vary from oven to oven, use wooden skewer to test cake for doneness. If skewer comes out dry, cake is done.
I371.4	Prepare icing while cake is baking. Sift confectioner’s sugar and mix well with part of the lemon juice. Best to use a teaspoon or small whisk. Pour icing over cake when it’s still warm and decorate as you fancy. I used lime zest. Enjoy!
R372	filled-doughnuts	1
I372.1	Even if it’s not yet noticeable, Carnival is in full swing and it’s just a matter of days before people are turning the streets of Venice, New Orleans and Rio into colorful pits of pleasure and debauchery. While we generally endorse an overall healthy, well-balanced and nutritious diet, we view carnival as an opportunity to finally pig out on all the food items we’ve been salivating over, but have rejected in order to attain that beach body/six pack we’ve been dreaming of. I say screw it. Life is way too short to not stuff your face with a heart-stopping amount of sugar and grease. At least for a couple days, before the guilt kicks and it’s #detox all over again.
R373	chinese-nougat	1
I373.1	Happy Chinese New Year to all of you! We hope you all had a fun time together with your loved ones back home or wherever you’ve chosen to step into the Year of the Monkey. We sure had a blast munching away at all those mouthwatering dishes we whipped up for our belly-bursting Lunar New Year feast.   There’s one thing I can assure you: The Kitchen Stories crew takes no prisoners. We ate it all. Everything. It was an equally formidable and brutal assertion of man’s dominance over the food chain. However, victory soon turned into bitter-sweet agony, as we squirmed on the ground, swearing to never touch Chinese food again—at least for the next couple of weeks. How foolish of us to think that this is even remotely a feasible undertaking. There’s no other way to put it: we’re suckers for Chinese cuisine. And, as we’re slowly emerging from our food comas, we yet again feel that strong urge to crank up the stove, whip out the wok, and just stir fry away.  While reenacting La Grande Bouffe probably ranks among the top three in every serious foodie’s preferred methods of ending one’s existence, we’ve chosen to embrace life and all the tasty future meals that come with it. And what’s life without all those sugary treats that make it worth living in the first place?! So make some room in your bellies for a belated Chinese New Year dessert, because here’s our tried and tested recipe for chewy Chinese nougat – a quick and easy fix for your sweet cravings.

It comes with a variety of different fillings to choose from that range from dainty, melting parmesan and ricotta cheese and spinach to minced pork and chicken and is usually served in a hearty broth or with cream sauce. This rendition, however, takes its cues from another famous Italian pasta dish – lasagna to be precise. Our tortellini casserole might not score in the authenticity department, but it sure does in terms of yumminess. A generous helping of dainty melting cheese and tomato sauce will convince even the staunchest of traditionalists. Check out the video for the complete recipe.
